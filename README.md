# Project Euler Problems: 100+ Math Challenges Solved, Documented, and Analyzed with O Notation

This repository contains my solutions to math problems from Project Euler, which I have solved between February 2022 and September 2023.  Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require problem-solving skills and programming techniques. I also documented the O note analysis for each problem at the end of each solution.

## Overview

- Total Problems Solved: 102
- Languages Used: python


## Usage

I recommend opening the solution notebooks directly in Google Colab. Opening the solutions in Google Colab provides an interactive environment where you can run the code, modify it, and experiment with different inputs easily. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run and explore the solution interactively.

## Contributions

I have personally solved these problems, but if you have alternative solutions or improvements, feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request. Please follow the existing coding style and provide clear documentation for your changes.

## License

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the Project Euler community for providing these challenging problems that have helped enhance my problem-solving and programming skills.

Note: I have successfully solved more than 100 problems. However, due to copyright concerns and the terms of use set by Project Euler, I am only able to share and post solutions for the first 100 problems in this repository. I only add two random problems outside the first 100 to spread some encouragement. I respect the intellectual property rights of Project Euler and encourage others to visit the official website to engage directly with the problems and solutions beyond the first 100.

I hope my solutions and the information provided here can still be helpful and inspire others in their own problem-solving journey.
